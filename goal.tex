\section{Challenges}
\label{ssec.challenges}
A testbed that allows researchers to execute code across donated embedded devices faces four major challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, the embedded devices pose a limited resources challenge. It is hard to
run heavy scripting languages, such as Python or Ruby. Unlike host-based or fixed server network testbeds,
router-based network testbeds deploy on resource-constrained devices that have too little RAM and flash storage. Therefore, our platform must be small and easy-to-deploy. To overcome this challenge, BISmark uses standard UNIX utilities and small C programs with shell and Lua scripts.
\item The second challenge is preserving the user's network experience. \sysname is on the direct
path of real Internet users. A malicious network measurement experiment will noticeably
 affect a normal user's network experience by consuming too much network resources. Therefore,
  our platform must ensure that a poorly designed experiment cannot disrupt a user's
  Internet connectivity. This presents a challenge for systems like BISmark. To fix
   this issue, it has to manually review each experiment's codes. Dasu uses a sandboxed environment for safe execution of experiment and limits resource consumption. However, it uses Drools so that we need to port from Java.
\item The third challenge is to reconcile the need for open data with user privacy.
Since a home router connects to many devices in a home network, they can generate valuable data
 for home network research study. However, this data can also threaten user privacy.
 For example, network traffic statistics can yield insight into user behavior and indicate
  when users are home. Due to these concerns, network testbeds either do not collect data
   from real Internet users or use limited data to what is collected from a controlled group of
    participants.
\item Further challenges remain regarding software upgrades. Unlike PlanetLab nodes
deployed in universities, network testbeds in home networks cannot get enough technical
support. In addition, OpenWrt's built-in \texttt{opkg} lacks features for managing software in the homes of non-technical users. Therefore, software management is a big challenge for \sysname.
\end{itemize}
With the further development of hardware technology, and what was learned from our
 previous practical experience,we know running Python codes on embedded devices can
 meet the first challenge. We ported \sysname onto a home wireless router, as described
 in \S{\ref{ssec.deployment}} and ran many network measurements (including
 multithreading, network programming, file handling, etc) as documented
 in \S{\ref{sec.evaluation}}. The second and third challenges can be solved by
  using a secure and performance-isolated sandbox (see \S{\ref{sec.sandbox}})
   and a reference monitor framework (see \S{\ref{sec.policy}}). Finally, \sysname
includes a software updater (see \S{\ref{sec.softwareupdater}}) to ensure system robustness.

\section{Goals}
\label{ssec.goals}
The goal of \sysname is to provide a scalable platform for running meaningful network experiments
 on home networks. It is designed to achieve:
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety: Internet users that participate in the testbed should not face significant risk
of damage to their devices or internet service. Code should be strictly sandboxed.
 Code executed on the testbed must not interfere with the performance of the user's
 Internet connection. As mentioned in \S{\ref{sec.motivation}}, there are a few
  potential risks in home networks, therefore we design a network measurement platform
   with user security and privacy as first-order concerns.

\item Privacy: Our goal is striving to maximize utility to experimenters while
not compromising the privacy of the user (e.g., expose home network usage behavior).

\item Flexibility: The related works in \S{\ref{ssec.related_work}} show that an
effective network measurement platform should support both passive and active measurements.
Passive measurements provide precise and continuous understanding of the network, while
 active measurements provide some insight into the way real traffic is treated within it.
Therefore, we require a wide range of APIs that support the broadest spectrum of
network measurements possible.

\item Lightweight: We desire the platform's weight to be as light as possible for two reasons.
First, because \sysname is deployed in home networks on resource-constrained
devices, it is impossible to run complex software. And, second, \sysname nodes
 are on the direct path of real Internet users. Hence, we don't want to impact users' Internet connectivity.

\item Accuracy: We desire the measurement platform to accurately track
general network information. Precise experiment data is able to help researchers
 better understand the network.

\item Easy to install and use: Unlike computer or mobile environments, many people are
not familiar with home wireless routers. Therefore, installation is a big challenge.
 We require that the router be easy to install, un-install, and stop.
\end{itemize}

\sysname's design (\S\ref{sec.design}) addresses the first three goals and
its implementation (\S\ref{sec.implementation}) the remaining goals.
