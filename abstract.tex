As one of the most economically significant and fastest growing sectors of the Internet, broadband networks have attracted interest from researchers. To better understand broadband networks, we developed Soar, an open research testbed that utilizes computational resources provided by end users on their home wireless routers with custom firmware. Unlike most other platforms, \sysname provides a privacy protection of embedded device data and maintains the security of donated device from potentially buggy experiment codes. We find that our platform is flexible enough to implement a variety of network measurements including the set of devices, aggregate traffic statistics, the characteristics of the WiFi environment and so on despite its security restrictions. This paper discusses some of the challenges we faced building and using a platform for deploying measurement in home networks, describe its design and implementation. We demonstrate Soar's utility with a case study: understanding congestion in home wireless networks. Through using channel busy-time as a direct measure of channel utilization and show how channel utilization along with network throughput and goodput can be used to identify the health of home network.
