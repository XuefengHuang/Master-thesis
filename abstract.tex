As one of the most economically significant and fastest growing sectors of 
the Internet, broadband networks have attracted interest from researchers. 
To better understand broadband networks, we developed Seattle, an open 
research and educational testbed that utilizes computational resources 
provided by end users on their home wireless routers with custom firmware. 
Unlike most other platforms, Seattle provides a privacy protection of 
embedded device data and maintains the security of donated device from 
potentially buggy experiment codes. We find that our platform is flexible 
enough to implement a variety of network measurements despite its security 
restrictions. This paper discusses some of the challenges we faced building 
and using a platform for deploying measurement in home networks, describe 
its design and implementation.
