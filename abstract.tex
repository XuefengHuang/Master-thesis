As one of the most economically significant and fastest growing sectors of the Internet, broadband networks have attracted interest from researchers. To better understand broadband networks, we developed SOAR, an open research testbed that utilizes computational resources provided by end users on their home wireless routers with custom firmware. Unlike most other platforms, \sysname provides a privacy protection of embedded device data and maintains the security of donated device from potentially buggy experiment codes. We find that our platform is flexible enough to implement a variety of network measurements including the set of devices, aggregate traffic statistics, the characteristics of the WiFi environment and so on despite its security restrictions. This paper discusses some of the challenges we faced building and using a platform for deploying measurement in home networks, describe its design and implementation. We demonstrate SOAR's utility with hybrid measurements: characterizing home wireless performance from the gateway view. We report on the makeup of home wireless network, network traffic statistics and performance characteristics. With this platform, we provide a real insight of home wireless networks and will help researchers to understand home networks better.
