\section{Related Work}
\label{sec.related_work}
Our work shares goals with and builds upon ideas from several prior large-
scale platforms targeting home network research.In the following paragraphs, 
we briefly review related works on network testbed. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{BISmark} is similar to Seattle in that it is deployed in home 
networks on resource-constrained devices. And currently it is used and 
shared by researchers at nine institutions, including commercial Internet 
service providers, and has enabled studies of access link performance, 
network connectivity, Web page load times, and user behavior and activity. 
However, vetting experiments is challenging. A poorly designed (or controlled
) experiment can cripple a user?s Internet connection. Seattle is supported 
to run arbitrary codes on remote devices without compromising the security 
and privacy of device owners.
\item \textbf{Samknows} has designed and developed its performance tests in 
house, adhering to IETF RFCs where appropriate. All measurements are written 
in C, for performance and portability across a range of hardware platforms. 
But it only supports limited performance measurements. Seattle supports a 
very flexible language for experiment specification based on a restricted 
subset of Python.
\item \textbf{The RIPE Atlas project} is a global network of probes that 
measure Internet connectivity and reachability, providing an unprecedented 
understanding of the state of the Internet in real time. It has deployed 
thousands of probing devices worldwide, but their capabilities are limited 
to simple measurements (e.g., ping, traceroute). Seattle instead provides a 
wide range of capabilities to support complex measurements. 
\item \textbf{Dasu} is a measurement experimentation platform for the 
Internet edge, It supports both controlled network experimentation and 
broadband characterization. But it is not able to run a range of  
measurements due to its capabilities are limited and cannot run continuous 
measurements (i.e. , since hosts can be turned off, moved, etc.).
\item \textbf{Scriptroute} provides a safe, publicly-available network probe 
execution environment, but ScriptRoute hasn?t been updated in a few years. 
Furthermore, it doesn?t support IPv6 and TCP options. Currently, Seattle not 
only engage in research projects, but also  allow students to get practical 
experience with real-world end user networks.

\item \textbf{Fathom} project explores the browser as a platform for network 
measurement and troubleshooting. It provides a wide range of networking 
primitives directly to in-page javaScript. You get direct TCP/UDP socket 
access, higher-level protocol APIs such as DNS, HTTP, and UPnP, and ready-
made functionality such as pings and traceroute. However, the measurements 
are not continuous(i.e. , since browser can be turned off, etc.). Seattle 
instead is deployed on home routers so that measurements are continuous, 
direct and comprehensive.
\item \textbf{HomeNet Profiler} is a software that runs on any computer 
connected inside a home network, to collect a wide range of measurements 
about networks including the set of devices, the set of services and the 
characteristics of the WiFi environment. But due to it lacks programming 
interface so HomeNet Profiler is not flexible. Its measurements are also not 
continuous. Seattle not only support these capabilities HomeNet Profiler 
has, but also allow more measurement primitives(traceroute, ping, etc...) 
while preserving security and privacy.
\item \textbf{Google Analytics} is an enterprise-class based web analytics 
tool which provides a transparent view of website traffic and marketing 
effectiveness. Google Analytics has powerful and advance features that give 
rich insight into the websites and improve website ROI (Return on Investment)
. But it only supports limited website performance measurements.
\item \textbf{IETF's LMAP} is a desire to be able to coordinate the 
execution of broadband measurements and the collection of measurement 
results across a large scale set of Measurement Agents (MAs). These MAs 
could be in every home gateway and edge device such as set-top boxes and 
tablet computers, and located throughout the Internet as well. The 
measurement system is under the direction of a single organisation and each 
MA may only have a single Controller at any point in time.
