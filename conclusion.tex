\chapter{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec.conclusion}
In this thesis, we presented \sysname, a experimental platform for home Wi-Fi routers. \sysname provides a programmable interface for writing and launching measurements, without compromising user's privacy and minimizing the impact on the performance of home wireless routers. We described SOAR's design and implementation and used our deployment to demonstrate how we ensure the security and privacy of participating nodes. By integrating \sysname into home networks, we get the benefits of a real world deployment, while keeping the flexibility to run measurements. We also presented a hybrid measurement that demonstrates SOAR's capabilities and illustrates the unique perspective it brings to network measurement.
