\chapter{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec.conclusion}
In this thesis, we presented \sysname, an experimental platform designed to run on home Wi-Fi routers. \sysname provides a programmable interface for writing and launching measurements without compromising user privacy and minimizing the impact on router performance. The greatly reduced risk of participation to router owners thus achieves a more diverse set of vantage points. We described \sysname's design, implementation and used our deployment to demonstrate how we ensure the security and privacy of participating devices. By integrating \sysname into home networks, we get the benefits of a real world deployment, while keeping the flexibility to run measurements. We also presented both active and passive measurements that demonstrate \sysname's capabilities and illustrates the unique perspective it brings to the network.
